# Add Items per household that have tags
  <!-- - Add list item that replaces the Item we know now. -->
  - We need to be able to manage Items
  - Organize Lists by item tags
  - Makes tags linked to households as well, so that anyone creates like item types.
  - Make Items Orderable
  # Add Tags to Recipe/Lists

# Merge Lists
  - Merge other lists together
  - Merge recipes into lists

# Make Lists/Recipes/Items orderable


# Make Recipes/Lists/Ingredients searchable/filterable

# recipe 'making' mode, where you can check off things that you have used and setups you have done (all local probably), we can do db stuff later
 - Make the Instructions, a multi step process rather than just a text box.


# Add more information for each of the steps that you can add if you want. The extra tips must be activated to look at them, (though there can be some display saying that there are more tips)

# add density to household items. Provide density lookup table.
